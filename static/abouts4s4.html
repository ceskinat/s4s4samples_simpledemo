<p>sharesfor is a messaging environment, designed to easily integrate into your current systems, 
relate to entities in them and provide your people with a familiar messaging environment 
to exchange and gather information about those entities.</p>
<p>In real life those entities may correspond to your customer, contact persons, projects, 
departments, or any other entities that apply to your business applications. </p>
<p>Each entity is referenced by a pair of Object Type and Object Id. You can configure your 
applications to start a new thread (or route your object/entity) by using this pair. 
Each object can have a list of  threads with different audience 
and each thread can relate to multiple objects (as tags)</p>
