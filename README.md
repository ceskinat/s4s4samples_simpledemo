This simple demo is developed to illustrate the integration and sample usage of sharesfor. 
This application simply features object types and objects and when clicked on, sharesfor is activated for the object (referred to as "subject" on sharesfor interfaces). You can create new objects and object types. 
A running version can be found in https://s4s4demo.pluralist.team/
